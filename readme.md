This might not be too bad if I can figure out how to make rectangles and apply textures with OpenGL.

The scales from top to bottom are:

Double Logarithmic (1 to 10 to 100)
Folded Single Logarithmic with index at Pi (π to 10, 1 to π)

Blue line denoting boundary between sliding bit and stationary bit

Folded Single Logarithmic with index at Pi (π to 10, 1 to π)
Red Inverse Single Logarithmic (10 to 1)
Single Logarithmic (1 to 10)

Blue line denoting boundary between sliding bit and stationary bit

Single Logarithmic (1 to 10)
Linear (0 to 1)
