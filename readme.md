# SwitchSlide
Like a slide rule, but for Switch.

So far I only have the cursor and a black background. Let's find out if I'm too dumb to figure out how to make the rest.

[How to use a slide rule.](https://www.sliderulemuseum.com/SR_Class/OS-ISRM_SlideRuleSeminar.pdf)

This might not be too bad if I can figure out how to make rectangles and apply textures with OpenGL.

The scales from top to bottom are:

1. Double Logarithmic (1 to 10 to 100)
2. Folded Single Logarithmic with index at Pi (π to 10, 1 to π)
* Blue line denoting boundary between sliding bit and stationary bit
3. Folded Single Logarithmic with index at Pi (π to 10, 1 to π)
4. Red Inverse Single Logarithmic (10 to 1)
5. Single Logarithmic (1 to 10)
* Blue line denoting boundary between sliding bit and stationary bit
6. Single Logarithmic (1 to 10)
7. Linear (0 to 1)
